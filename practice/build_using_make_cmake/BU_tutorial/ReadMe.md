# Writing Make Files
source: https://www.cs.bu.edu/teaching/cpp/writing-makefiles/

The original tutorial is only for `Makefile`.

## 1
First a `make_tutorial_hello_world` toturial is illustrating the `make`.


## 2
The `cmake_tutorial_hello_world` toturial is illustrating the `cmake`.
The orginal files in this folder are: (1) main.cpp; (2)CMakeLists; [Readme.md]
CMakeLists is used to generate Makefile by `cmake .`.
Then exetuable file can be generated by `make`.


## 3
The `make_tutorial` is from BU, which is similar to the `make_tutorial_hello_world`, this directory also provide ideas:
(1) how to call functions in other files from main.cpp using headfiles
(2) it instructs how to build executable file from source code using g++ and makefile



## 4
We create a `CMakeLists.txt` in the `cmake_tutorial` based on the original file in `make_tutorial` .
