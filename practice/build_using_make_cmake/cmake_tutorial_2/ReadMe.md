# Writing Make Files
source: https://www.cs.bu.edu/teaching/cpp/writing-makefiles/

Similarly like tutorial 1, this directory also provide ideas:
(1) how to call functions in other files from main.cpp using headfiles
(2) it instructs how to build executable file from source code using g++ and makefile

Here we use make tutorial to test the cmake.
